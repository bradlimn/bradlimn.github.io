title: nearly updated my pc

> I've already returned the i7-10700K.

Earlier this week, Amazon had the new Intel i7-10700K on sale for $387 with a ship date in early June. Recently, I have been thinking about updating my PC, so I pulled the trigger and planned to do some research over the weekend to decide if I would cancel the order before it shipped. Surprise! It shipped same day.

My current setup is an Intel i7-4790K (Devil's Canyon), which I originally built in 2014. I had assumed a processor 6 years and an equal number of generations newer would be remarkably quicker. To really test this out before practically rebuilding my PC, I fired up 3DMark to run some benchmarks.

I ran "Time Spy" a couple times and compared the results to benchmarks posted by others running the new i7-10700K and my current graphics card (RTX 2070 SUPER). I was not impressed. Those newer builds are only about 4.5% faster on the two graphics metrics (Graphics Test 1 and Graphics Test 2). For example, 62.91 fps vs. 65.72 fps for Graphics Test 1.

The performance gains from upgrading the motherboard (Z490), RAM (32GB DDR4), processor (i7-10700K), and storage (1TB NVMe PCIe M.2) in my system are just not worth the roughly 5% graphics improvement. I'd be paying nearly $200 per percentage point! Eek.

I've already returned the i7-10700K. Let's see if my trusty Devil's Canyon can holdout until DDR5 is mass market, Intel gets off 14nm, or something else changes the desktop performance landscape.
